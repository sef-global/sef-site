                    <p class="paragraph">Growing up in a rural village, I was rarely exposed to English. It was
                        extremely difficult for me to string together a few English words. There were numerous occasions
                        when I struggled because of that. I still remember answering the questions in the WSO2
                        scholarship interview in English, so I asked if I could answer in Sinhala instead. Even though I
                        could understand what was being said, it was very difficult to speak. It was extremely difficult
                        for me to complete my studies on campus because everything was in English. I wrote down and
                        memorized everything I wanted to say. After a while, I was fortunate enough to be accepted into
                        the upspeak beta program with Minuri Adasooriya. Then I got used to talking, and my fears faded
                        away. Today, I am able to communicate in English very fluently. It provided numerous
                        opportunities for me. I was able to complete my education very successfully and graduated with
                        first-class honours. I've also had the opportunity to lead organizations such as SEF. Moreover,
                        I was also able to collaborate with a number of international companies, including OpenMRS and
                        Google. It's what I like to call a turning point in my life.
